Topic: central-dogma-molecular-biology
- The core principle describing the flow of genetic information in biological systems
- Replication: The process of copying a cell's DNA
- Transcription: Creating a messenger RNA (mRNA) copy from a DNA template
- Translation: Synthesizing a protein from the mRNA template at the ribosome
- Notable exceptions like reverse transcription in retroviruses

Topic: supply-and-demand
- A foundational economic model for determining the price of a good in a market
- The Law of Demand: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases
- The Law of Supply: As price increases, quantity supplied increases
- Market Equilibrium: The price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded
- Factors that cause shifts in the supply or dmand curves, such as changes in technology or consumer preferences

Topic: fall-of-the-roman-empire
- A gradual, complex process of decline rather than a single event
- Internal pressures: Political instability, civil wars, and economic decay
- External pressures: Constant invasions and migrations by so-called "barbarian" tribes
- The formal division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves
- Over-reliance on non-Roman mercenaries, leading to a decline in military loyalty and effectiveness

Topic: heros-journey
- A common narrative archetype, or monomyth, identified in global storytelling
- The Call to Adventure: The hero receives a challenge that takes them from their ordinary world
- Crossing the Threshold: The hero commits to the quest and enters an unknown world
- The Ordeal: The central crisis where the hero faces their greatest fear and "dies" to be reborn
- The Return with the Elixir: The hero comes back to their ordinary world with a treasure, wisdom, or love to share

Topic: general-relativity
- Albert Einstein's geometric theory of gravitation
- The Equivalence Principle: The effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration
- Spacetime as a single, four-dimensional manifold
- Mass and energy curve or warp the fabric of spacetime
- Objects follow the straightest possible path, called a geodesic, through this curved spacetime

Topic: transformer-architecture
- A deep learning model architecture that excels at handling sequential data, like natural language
- Avoids recurrence and instead relies on a self-attention mechanism
- Positional encodings are added to give the model information about word order
- Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces
- The core structure often consists of an encoder and a decoder stack

Topic: diatonic-harmony
- The system of musical harmony based on the notes of the major and minor scales
- Building triads (three-note chords) on each of the seven scale degrees
- Functional Harmony: The concept that chords have specific roles (Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant)
- Cadences: Harmonic formulas that create a sense of resolution or pause
- Chord progressions as the basis for creating harmonic movement and interest

Topic: maillard-reaction
- A chemical reaction responsible for the browning and flavor of many cooked foods
- Occurs between amino acids and reducing sugars under the application of heat
- Creates a complex mixture of hundreds of different aroma and flavor compounds
- Distinct from caramelization, which involves only the pyrolysis of sugars
- Examples include seared steak, toasted bread, and roasted coffee beans

Topic: acid-base-titration
- A laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine concentration
- A solution of known concentration (titrant) is used to neutralize a solution of unknown concentration (analyte)
- The Equivalence Point: The point at which the moles of acid equal the moles of base
- Use of a pH indicator or pH meter to identify the endpoint of the reaction
- Plotting a titration curve (pH vs. volume of titrant added) to analyze the reaction profile
