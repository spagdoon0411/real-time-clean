    Hello everyone, welcome to today's presentation. I want to talk about three main things.
    
    First, let me introduce the concept of real-time transcription. It's a technology that 
    converts speech to text as you speak, with minimal delay. This is incredibly useful for 
    accessibility and productivity.
    
    Second, I want to discuss the challenges we face. The main issues are handling background 
    noise, dealing with different accents, and managing the computational cost of real-time 
    processing. These are not trivial problems.

    Now let me give you a concrete example of how this works in practice. Imagine you're in 
    a meeting and someone is speaking about quarterly results. The transcription system needs 
    to keep up with their pace while maintaining accuracy.
    
    Going back to the challenges I mentioned earlier, the computational cost is particularly 
    significant when you're processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. We've found that 
    GPU acceleration helps a lot, but it does increase infrastructure costs.
